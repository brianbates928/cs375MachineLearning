This is the MNIST data set that consists of lots of images, each having 28x28 pixels. By today's standards, this may seem relatively tiny, but only a few years ago was quite challenging computationally, and it motivated the development of several ML algorithms and models that are now state-of-the-art  solutions for much bigger data sets.\n",
